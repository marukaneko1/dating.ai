## What's Different from "Matches"?

| Feature | Matches Page | Messages Page |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Purpose** | See all matches | Communicate with matches |
| **View** | Grid of profile cards | List of conversations |
| **Info Shown** | Profile photos | Last message + time |
| **Action** | Click to chat | Click to chat |
| **Focus** | Discovery | Communication |
| **Unread** | No indicators | Shows unread badges |

**Both pages lead to the same chat interface, but Messages is optimized for communication!**
