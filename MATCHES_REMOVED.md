## User Flow

### Old Flow:

```

### New Flow:
```
Discover → Match → Messages Page → Click to Chat → Chat Page
```

**Simplified!** Users go directly from matching to the Messages page.

## Why This Change?

### Benefits:
1. **Simplified navigation** - One less tab to maintain
2. **Clearer purpose** - Messages is the communication hub
3. **Less redundancy** - Matches and Messages showed similar info
4. **Better UX** - Users know exactly where to go to communicate
5. **Cleaner interface** - Streamlined navigation bar

### What Users See Now:
- **Likes:** See who liked you (discovery)
- **Messages:** Talk to your matches (communication)
- No overlap or confusion

---

## What Still Works

✅ **Everything still functions normally:**
- Matching system works
- Real-time messaging works
- Chat functionality intact
- All matches appear in Messages
- Conversation list shows all matched users
- Profile photos, last messages, timestamps
- Unread indicators

**The only change is navigation - the Matches page is no longer accessible.**

   - Removed Matches link from navigation

2. **`frontend/src/App.tsx`**
   - Removed Matches import
   - Removed /matches route

## Access Points

### How to See Your Matches:
1. **Messages Page** (`/messages`)
   - Shows all your matches in a conversation list
   - Click any match to start chatting
   - See profile photos, names, last messages

2. **Discover Page** (`/`)
   - When you match, you're notified
   - Can navigate to Messages to chat

### For Both Users & Admin:
- Regular users: See their matches in Messages
- Admin users: See their matches in Messages
- No difference in access or functionality

---

## Testing

### Test the New Flow:

1. **Login** (user or admin)
2. **Match with someone** in Discover
3. **Click "Messages"** in navigation
4. **See your match** in the conversation list
5. **Click to chat**

The Matches link is gone, but all functionality remains!

## Rollback (If Needed)

If you want to bring back the Matches section:

1. Re-add the import in `App.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   import Matches from './pages/Matches';
   ```

2. Re-add the route in `App.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   <Route path="/matches" element={<PrivateRoute><Layout><Matches /></Layout></PrivateRoute>} />
   ```

3. Re-add the link in `Layout.tsx`:
   ```typescript
   <Link to="/matches">Matches</Link>
   ```
