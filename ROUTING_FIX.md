# 🔧 Routing Fix - Profile Setup Redirect

## ✅ Problem Fixed

**Before**: After login with incomplete profile, refreshing the page would show the homepage (which would break because no profile exists).

**After**: Users without profiles are automatically redirected to `/profile-setup` until they complete it.

---

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### Login Flow

```
1. User logs in → Login successful
2. Navigate to "/" (homepage)
3. PrivateRoute checks:
   - ❌ Not logged in? → Redirect to /login
   - ❌ No profile? → Redirect to /profile-setup  
   - ✅ Has profile? → Show homepage
```

### Profile Setup Flow

```
1. User on /profile-setup
2. Can skip any/all steps
3. Click finish → Profile created
4. RefreshUser() → Updates context with new profile
5. Navigate to "/" → Now shows homepage (has profile)
```

### Refresh Flow

```
1. User refreshes page
2. AuthContext loads user from token
3. PrivateRoute checks user.profile
4. If no profile → Redirect to /profile-setup
5. If has profile → Show requested page
```

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. App.tsx - PrivateRoute Component

Added profile check:

```typescript
if (!user) {
  return <Navigate to="/login" />;
}

// Check if user has a profile, if not redirect to profile setup
if (!user.profile) {
  return <Navigate to="/profile-setup" />;
}

return <>{children}</>;
```

### 2. ProfileSetup.tsx

Added user refresh after profile creation:

```typescript
// Refresh user data to update the profile in context
await refreshUser();

// Navigate to home
navigate('/');
```

Also added default values if user skips:
- Bio: "New user on Dating.ai"
- Location: "San Francisco, CA"

## 🎉 Benefits

✅ **No broken pages** - Users can't access pages requiring profile data without a profile  
✅ **Smooth onboarding** - Automatic redirect to setup  
✅ **Persistent state** - Refreshing doesn't break the flow  
✅ **Clear flow** - Users always know what to do next  
✅ **Admin testing** - Admin always starts with fresh profile setup

## 🔍 Technical Details

### PrivateRoute Logic
```typescript
1. Check loading state → Show loading screen
2. Check authentication → Redirect to login if not authenticated
3. Check profile existence → Redirect to setup if no profile
4. Allow access → Show protected content
```

### Profile Check
The backend returns:
```json
{
  "id": "user-id",
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "profile": null  // or profile object if exists
}
```

Frontend checks:
```typescript
if (!user.profile) {
  return <Navigate to="/profile-setup" />;
}
```
